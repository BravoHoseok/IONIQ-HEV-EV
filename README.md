This section demonstrates what was challenging issues, how to research them, and how to solve them

### Challenge #1 - Ameliorating the non-linear sensitivity of slide touch sensors by devising software algorithms
When implementing a tap function by using slide touch sensors that are composed of interlaced patterned two nodes, irregular sensitivity was caused in the entire area of slide touch sensors, for the slide touch sensors were designed with a small size, erratic patterns in the connection, and the sensors were located under a concave cover panel. To ensure the constant sensitivity of slide touch sensors, I introduced the software algorithm, variable threshold using interpolation

### Approach and Solution #1
**(Step 1)** Collected touch information (i.e., coordinates, sensitivity) through SPI communication from touch microprocessor<br>
**(Step 2)** Made a two-dimensional lookup table having 30 elements that represents that X-axis is a coordinate and the Y-axis is a sensitivity value corresponding to the the coordinate of X-axis<br>
**(Step 3)** Calculated a threshold value (80 % of maximum sensitivity value) corresponding to a new position value from the lookup table by using a two-dimensional interpolation<br>
**(Step 4)** Decided the slide touchâ€™s on-off state from sensitivity values and the calculated threshold<br>

<strong>Fig.1) the design pattern of slide(wheel touch sensors</strong>
<p>

**Fig.1)** shows the pattern of slide (wheel) touch sensor. When implementing 'Tap' gesture function by utilizing the slider touch sensor, the sensitivity sum of each sensor segment will be used to detect finger's touch state (touched or non-touched). In order to implement 'Tap' gesture function, the entire slider touch sensor should have the constant sensitivity regardless of the position of 'Tap' gesture on the slider touch sensor like **Fig.2)**. If the slider touch sensor does not show this consistency, a user definitely will feel the irregular sensitivity in the touch system.

<p>

However, as shown in **Fig.3)**, it is different in the real world. The reason is that the slide touch sensors were designed with a small size, erratic patterns between the connection, and the sensors were located under a concave cover panel.

**Fig.4)** shows the entire flow chart of the algorithm. By introducing this solution, the slider touch system can ensure the constant sensitivity, generating variable threshold corresponding to a specific position as shown in **Fig.5)**. Elements of the lookup table have to be measured in advanced by a robot arm machine.

### Result #1
Kept irregular sensitivities of the slider touch sensor constant, regardless of the quality of it, thus saving costs spent on changing the slider touch sensor design.<br>

### Challenge #2 - Developing an algorithm extracting position in the wheel touch sensor that is composed of interlaced patterned 3 nodes
When using microprocessors of suppliers, they normally provide application interface as a library. Likewise, we also were provided interface software calculating positions of a moving touch object on the wheel touch sensor. However, it was evident that this library would make malfunctions, for the supplier programmed the library in the situation where touch sensors and PCB were ideally designed. Actually, since we had many limitations such as small sensors and poor PCB layout, the library calculating positions of touch object did not provide reliable outcome. To resolve this problem, I devised the new algorithm calculating positions.

### Approach and Solution #2
**(Step 1)** Implemented an algorithm calculating positions by utilizing the sensitivity ratio of each segment on the wheel touch sensor<br>
**(Step 2)** Programmed this algorithm, integrating it into a touch software platform<br>
**(Step 3)** Verified the algorithm with tons of test cases<br>

<p>

**Fig.6)** shows the sensitivity of each segment on the wheel touch sensor, when moving a finger to clock wise and counter clock wise. By applying this pattern, we can calculate the coordinates as shown position value graph. The *_delta in the pseudocode below means the sensitivity of each segment.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if(ch1_delta > ch2_delta) // S1<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;{<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ch0_Ratio = ch0_delta / (ch0_delta + ch2_delta + 1);<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ch2_Ratio = ch2_delta / (ch0_delta + ch2_delta + 1);<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;GetUserPosition(ch0_Ratio, ch2_Ratio, 0);//0 means S1(Section1), S2(Section2)<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;else // S6<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;{<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;seg1_Ratio = seg1_delta / (seg1_delta + seg2_delta + 1);<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;seg2_Ratio = seg2_delta / (seg1_delta + seg2_delta + 1);<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;GetUserPosition(seg1_Ratio, seg2_Ratio, 2);//2 means S5(Section5), S6(Section6)<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;}<br>
}<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;{<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ch1_Ratio = ch1_delta / (ch1_delta + ch0_delta + 1);<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ch0_Ratio = ch0_delta / (ch1_delta + ch0_delta + 1);<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;GetUserPosition(ch1_Ratio, ch0_Ratio, 0);//0 means S1(Section1), S2(Section2)<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;}<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;else // S3<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;{<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ch1_Ratio = Ch1_delta / (Ch1_delta + CH2_delta + 1);<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ch2_Ratio = Ch2_delta / (Ch1_delta + Ch22_delta + 1);<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;GetUserPosition(Ch2_Ratio, Ch1_Ratio, 1);//1 means S3(Section3), S4(Section4)<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;}<br>
}<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if(ch0_delta > ch1_delta) // S5<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;{<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ch1_Ratio = ch2_delta / (ch2_delta + ch0_delta + 1);<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ch0_Ratio = ch0_delta / (ch2_delta + ch0_delta + 1);<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;GetUserPosition(ch0_Ratio, ch2_Ratio, 2);//2 means S0(Section0), S6(Section6)<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;GetUserPosition(Ch2_Ratio, Ch1_Ratio, 1);//1 means S3(Section3), S4(Section4)<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if(Section)<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;{<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;result = (mul2 + (mul1/sum));<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;}<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; result = (mul1/sum);<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;}<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;retrun result;<br>
}<br>

### Result #2
Implemented the reliable algorithm calculating coordinates. Also, since I reduced the range of position jitter by implementing filter algorithms, this algorithm can be used in the wheel touch sensors that is made of just 3 nodes without adding extra touch sensor nodes, saving costs spent on the wheel touch sensor design.

### Challenge #3 - Designing SPI driver between two heterogeneous microprocessors
To minimize the number of ports used in exchanging data between two microprocessors, we adopted the SPI communication.
When developing SPI driver, the communication failure was caused by the different operation speed of the two microprocessors: 32-bit RH850-F1K (Renesas) and 8-bit ATtiny1616 (Microchip). If the 32-bit microprocessor generates next clock to receive next date before the 8-bit microprocessor complete writing valid data to its data buffer, the 32-bit microprocessor is going to receive previous data or garbage data from the 8-bit microprocessor's data buffer.

### Approach and Solution #3
**(Step 1)** Designed the concept of SPI driver by applying the ready port that indicates the state of the 8-bit microprocessor as an interrupt signal<br>
**(Step 2)** Designed the necessary elements used in the SPI driver module: data structure, state machine, logic flow chart, module dependency<br>
**(Step 3)** Defined the SPI communication protocol: command, data length, identification, receive, send, acknowledge<br>
**(Step 4)** Programmed the SPI driver of two microprocessors according to the design concepts<br>
**(Step 5)** Integrated the programmed modules into the SW platform and the touch platform respectively<br>

<strong>Fig.7) the block diagram of SPI communication</strong>
<p>

**Fig.7)** shows the structure of the SPI communication block diagram. By recognizing a ready port as an 'Interrupt Port', the 32-bit microprocessor can confirm whether 8bit-microprocessor completed writing data it's data buffer or not. Normally, I2C hardware component provides 'Clock Stretch function' that alerts the state of data buffers to a master MCU. However, unlike I2C, SPI does not have this function. To design SPI communication driver module, I applied a ready port concept like 'Clock Stretch' to this SPI driver.

### Result #3
Built know-how in designing the SPI communication.

### Challenge #4 - Creating software update system for a secondary microprocessor in a complete car
As two microprocessors (32-bit and 8-bit) are applied in our product, I decided to provide the software update function of
the secondary microprocessor in complete car in order to perform projects efficiently in terms on time and costs.

### Research and Solution #4
**(Step 1)** Designed the concept of the software update system from an external tool to the target microprocessor<br>
**(Step 2)** Developed FBL (Flash Boot Loader) of the target microprocessor<br>
**(Step 3)** Implemented the gateway module (CAN-SPI, CAN-I2C) to transfer binary data from the main microprocessor to the target microprocessor<br>
**(Step 4)** Designed memory field used in Script tool, such as Flash Boot Loader, Application, Validation Check, Variation<br>
**(Step 5)** Invented Script tools that convert different types of Hex files (Intel, Motorola) to a suitable format and merge them<br>
**(Step 6)** Developed the external update tool that sends the update file through diagnostic-CAN<br>

**Fig.8)** shows the structure of the 8-bit microprocessor memory. Flash Boot Loader(FBL) is located in BOOT section, and FBL will erase and rewrite application code and data section.

<img src="./Img/AEPE_Update.jpg"><br>
<strong>Fig.9) the structure of the entire update system</strong>
<p>

**Fig.9)** shows the structure of the entire update system. Through 'Script Tool', several Hex files can be changed  Motorola Hex format to Intel Hex format and be merged one Hex file being used in the update process. The 32-bit microprocessor receives the date of the Hex file from the Diagnostic-CAN, and GateWay module transfroms CAN protocol to SPI protocol format. To communicate between 32-bit microprocessor and 8-bit one, I defined SPI protocol frame used in Flash Boot Loader. The CHG pin is used in this update system in order to inform whether the 8-bit microprocessor complete the works such as erase, write, jump to other sections, checksum.

### Result #4
Saved the time and costs spent on the software update from 15 min per one product to 1 min per one product, from $22 per one product to $1.5 per one product respectively.
